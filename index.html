        <!-- first section -->
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Hello!

            These are the results of a survey I posted recently, which aimed to ask the Github userbase what their
            thoughts on the controversial change of the default branch on Github (and by extension, Git) from 'master'
            to an alternative phrase like 'main' or 'trunk'.

            The name change was proposed as a response to the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, demanding equal rights
            and restructure of the American police system in response to the violent, tragic and reckless murders of
            innocent black men, women and children at the hands of police.
            
            <br><br>
            This proposed change has divided opinions within Github's user base. Github has claimed that the use of the word
            'master' has connotations to slavery in many countries, and it is being changed to make black developers feel
            more comfortable on the platform. However, many others have argued that the change is meaningless to the cause,
            distracts the public from the actual issues faced by real black people, and that the change breaks CI solutions
            and other habits. However, many others also support the change, believing that it is expanding inclusivity, and
            it is also a chance to change the name of the branch to something more meaningful or a name which expresses the
            branch's purpose more clearly.

            <br><br>
            In the wake of this, I decided to create this survey to ask the users of Github directly what they thought about
            the change. I also decided to collect information about the responder's ethnicity, country of residence and gender,
            in order to gauge the demographics which were mainly for and against the change.
        </p>

        <h2>Demographics</h2>

        <p>
            The survey spanned many different countries, reaching people who identified with around 16 different
            ethnic groups. The survey was also taken by several people who did not identify as either male or female.
            However, the majority of people who responded were white, and the most prevalent gender identity to respond
            was male, followed up by females. This was expected based on how the majority of people involved in computer
            science (and therefore, users of Github) are white males. Despite this however, many users chose not to
            disclose their gender identity, so the true distribution is not known.

            Perhaps unsurprisingly, the United States came in with the most responses by 29.5%, followed closely by many
            European countries. I did not list all countries in Europe, but many responses from other countries in Europe
            responded, taking up about 29% of all responses. Based on the ethnic data, I'm guessing most of these are from
            countries like Russia, the Netherlands, Spain, and so on. In hindsight, I probably should have included more
            countries in the list.

            The general opinion for most users is that they are <b>against</b> this change. 70% of all participants said
            that they are against the change, with only 15.7% being in support of the change. The other 14.3% fall under
            'Maybe' and 'Don't care', though their actual opinions are usually mixed and lean towards one of the two main
            options. Based on the written responses from users who were asked to explain their responses, most reasoning
            for their responses is as follows:
            <br><br>
            <b>For</b>
            <ul>
                <li>It is outdated terminology, and changing it from 'master' to some other alternative in order to create
                    a more inclusive space is worth the effort.
                </li>
                <li>It is an opportunity to pick a more meaningful name which better expresses what the branch actually does.
                    It is difficult to understand exactly what 'master' means on first encounter, whereas something like 'main'
                    would make much more sense.
                </li>
                <li>The name 'master' simply doesn't make sense to some users. It is now legacy terminology, and holding onto
                    it would simply be impractical.
                </li>
                <li>Some are not bothered either way, but feel that if individuals are offended by it they are supportive of
                    changing it to something else.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <b>Against</b>
            <ul>
                <li>This action is being taken as a form of 'virtue signalling', Github and Microsoft merely did this in order
                    to jump onto a bandwagon while the Black Lives Matter movement was gaining momentum on social media.
                </li>
                <li>Several African Americans who responded stated that it was <i>more</i> offensive to change it, since it
                    comes across as white people "thinking we are "vulnerable" and need protecting" from a word which they
                    understand has multiple meanings in different contexts.
                </li>
                <li>It is an impractical change which will break workflows, continuous integration (CI) setups and several other
                    automated scripts which will require manual fixing later.
                </li>
                <li>Using the word 'master' depends on the context being used. In Git, it is widely understood that the word
                    'master' is used to mean master copy (the original copy which all derivatives are made from), and nobody
                    associates the word in this context with it's master/slave connotation.
                </li>
                <li>Several git tutorials and walkthroughs will become obselete.</li>
                <li>It is introducing politics into a website which is not and has not ever been involved in politics, and it
                    is creating a social issue where there actually isn't one to begin with.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            It is clear that most users believe it is an unnecessary change, which breaks automated workflows, is insensitive
            given the current political landscape in the world, offensive to the group of people they are trying to be inclusive
            of, and suggests that Github and/or Microsoft are simply only interested in doing this to gain favor in public opinion.
           
            <br><br>
            However, some users also believe that it is time to rid the industry of questionable terminology, which could possibly
            offend certain people, and is confusing and unclear in it's meaning given the context it is used in, and should be
            swapped out with clearer and less ambiguous terminology.

            <br><br>
            Those who were in support of the change were asked to pick from a list of alternative names for the branch which they
            preferred, or suggest their own. The most popular one chosen by participants was 'main' with 47.6% of votes, followed
            by 'trunk' with 14.3%. Several other names were suggested which are listed below.
