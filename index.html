        <!-- first section -->
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Hello!

            These are the results of a survey I posted recently, which aimed to ask the Github userbase what their
            thoughts on the controversial change of the default branch on Github (and by extension, Git) from 'master'
            to an alternative phrase like 'main' or 'trunk'.

            The name change was proposed as a response to the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, demanding equal rights
            and restructure of the American police system in response to the violent, tragic and reckless murders of
            innocent black men, women and children at the hands of police.
            
            <br><br>
            This proposed change has divided opinions within Github's user base. Github has claimed that the use of the word
            'master' has connotations to slavery in many countries, and it is being changed to make black developers feel
            more comfortable on the platform. However, many others have argued that the change is meaningless to the cause,
            distracts the public from the actual issues faced by real black people, and that the change breaks CI solutions
            and other habits. However, many others also support the change, believing that it is expanding inclusivity, and
            it is also a chance to change the name of the branch to something more meaningful or a name which expresses the
            branch's purpose more clearly.

            <br><br>
            In the wake of this, I decided to create this survey to ask the users of Github directly what they thought about
            the change. I also decided to collect information about the responder's ethnicity, country of residence and gender,
            in order to gauge the demographics which were mainly for and against the change.

            The survey spanned many different countries, reaching people who identified with around 16 different
            ethnic groups. The survey was also taken by several people who did not identify as either male or female.
            However, the majority of people who responded were white, and the most prevalent gender identity to respond
            was male, followed up by females. This was expected based on how the majority of people involved in computer
            science (and therefore, users of Github) are white males. Despite this however, many users chose not to
            disclose their gender identity, so the true distribution is not known.

            Perhaps unsurprisingly, the United States came in with the most responses by 29.5%, followed closely by many
            European countries. I did not list all countries in Europe, but many responses from other countries in Europe
            responded, taking up about 29% of all responses. Based on the ethnic data, I'm guessing most of these are from
            countries like Russia, the Netherlands, Spain, and so on. In hindsight, I probably should have included more
            countries in the list.
