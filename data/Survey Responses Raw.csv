----Shallow because---
Starting with the fact that ""master"" in this case doesn't denote a master/slave relation but the principality of one of the branches thus has nothing to do with the BLM movement.
Secondly, In informatics naming has always proceeded using behavioural terms inspired to real-world phenomena (e.g. P2P, Client/Server, Banker's Algorithm, Master/Slave etc.) using this terms says nothing about being in favour or not of the existence of those terms in the real world nor the political position of the user.

---Hypocritical because---
making these changes will not support the improvement of society towards the reduction of systemic racism and won't lead to a more egalitarian society, but it's just a language paint job so that we can fake these things don't exist in the real world at the expense of lots of practical nuisances.

---Inappropriate because---
Making this change to wash the image of a private company is an exploitation of a rightful cause just to make a company APPEAR more rightful without taking real action to make changes towards a better society.
